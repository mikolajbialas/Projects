# Animal Board Game Simulation


## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation game that features various animals interacting on a board. Each animal is represented with unique attributes and behaviors, showcasing object-oriented programming and basic game mechanics.

## Features
-   **Animal Classes**: Includes different animal types, each with specific properties and methods. Example animals are Birds, Owls, and Vultures.
-   **Game Board**: The board where the animals are placed and interact with each other.
-   **Point System**: A basic system to track positions of animals on the board.
-   **Simulation Mechanics**: Ability to move animals on the board, interact, and simulate basic behaviors.

## Project Structure
 - `main.py`: Manages the game board and animal interactions.
-   `Animals.py`: Contains the classes for different types of animals.
-   `Point.py`: A utility class for managing point coordinates on the board.
