# Welcome to Password Manager!

Hi, I am Mikołaj Białaś creator of Password Manager. Below are instructions on what to do to make the program work properly.

## Before you run a programme
You need to add environment variables before running the program. To do this you need to find the "Edit configurations..." button. , which is located under the selected configuration. And then go to the environment variables and change the values of ICON and PASSWORD_FILE_PATH.
In the value for ICON you specify the path to the file 'pm_icon.ico'.
In the value for PASSWORD_FILE_PATH you specify the path where you want to save your passwords.
In the value for PYTHON_MAIL you will need to add your gmail address.
In the vale for EMAIL_PASSWORD you will need to add generated gmail password. You can find out more about generating passwords here "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXiPshHn9Pw&ab_channel=TweakLibrary".


## About Password Manager
Password manager is a program that is designed to store your passwords in a .json file. There are options such as adding data, deleting data, finding data, changing already existing data, clearing the database or saving to another file. The program will ask the user for a password for the program and an email when logging in for the first time. The email and password can be changed after logging into the program. Email is also needed to recover a forgotten password.
